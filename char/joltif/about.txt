Joltif is a goldblood nerd-o who's not ashamed to call out anyone for being slightly wrong. He's the "um, actually" of Troll society.
Either way, he's super great at doing technology things. Think of Sollux Captor but a lot more nerdy and stupid.
He has the ability to concentrate and charge controlled EMPs from his hands alone, being able to knock-out and shut down even the most resilient of tech. This comes in useful for debugging - or *de-bugging*.
His current projects seem to be managing a small website named "HumanCall", a listing site for holding biographies of human characters he has created. He also is working on many, many, many other things alongside that.
