Landon is (or, I guess, would be) one of the most obvious water-drinking note-taking file-signing no-sleep-getting legislacerators you would possibly ever see if you were just seeing them on the street for the first time. 
They're the type to sit calmly in a hammock and watch ironic commentaries on an off-day. And they really do want one.
A professional against their demand, Landon spends their days begrudgingly preparing for one of the worst jobs of their life, in their opinion. They just want to chill out for a while and do nothing, perhaps for an extended amount of time (one "business week").
On the more outward-facing hand, they do appreciate the good looks of the average business suit, and they absolutely do wear one almost all of the time, even if they're not on the clock. Glasses are a must too.
