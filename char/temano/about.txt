Temano is a guy who loves competitions. Trying things out, ranking, then sharpening his craft - that's the loop he lives by in life. He's Joltif's matesprit, and they really do get along well.
His abilities to control the temporal rate of things happening around him allow him to "time travel", and to retrace his steps to the past. However, doing so completely erases the future. This allows him to get into complex loops, and he preserves knowledge and reflexes from the future, so he uses this extra time to help himself improve.
That being said, yes, he's a time-travelling Mary Sue. Well -- some things he can't change. But that's dependent on fate, usually.
Despite this, however, his matespritship with Joltif blossomed without needing to pull some complex Mary Sue time travel antics. They were very good friends, finding each other over many well-played games of Gruber. Then, they met, and things went great from there.
