The Futuristic made life from a desolate planet using nothing but her own tech. In a way she trapped them all there in doing it. She gave her tech to her descendant. Creating a promise. A promise of freedom should her lineage die. How that would be granted. Who knows. 
Capaca herself hates interacting with most. She will talk to the occasional pirate. But she won’t like it. She wont enjoy it. She does love studying technology and the sea. 
She’s moirails with Cienci and they tend to build elaborate robots together.
