Simple Rustblood that lives super far from any kind of cities, he keeps himself busy with small farms and interacting with the local fauna, though when he's not doing that, he looks at social media, mainly at his favorite person of all time, Xyuaad Kleufi. His telekinetic abilities aren't the strongest, but they're strong enough lift small objects or put up a decent fight.
