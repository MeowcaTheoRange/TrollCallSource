Thaero is my main OC. He's basically my sona, if I was stupid, dumb, and a troll.
Sorry, man.
Anyway, he's basically a grey human, as they say in the Homestuck fandom.
I haven't read enough of Act 5+ to really understand the effects of Trolls within the Homestuck universe, but I'm assuming it's quite a bit.
I don't care, though.
