Joltif is a goldblood nerd-o who's not ashamed to call out anyone for being slightly wrong. He's the "um, actually" of Troll society.
Either way, he's super great at doing technology things. Think of Sollux Captor but a lot more nerdy and stupid.
He has the ability to concentrate and charge controlled EMPs from his hands alone, being able to knock-out and shut down even the most resilient of tech. This comes in useful for debugging - or *de-bugging*.
His current projects seem to be managing a small website named "HumanCall", a listing site for holding biographies of human characters he has created. He also is working on many, many, many other things alongside that.
His most notable relationship is with Keelez -- possibly the worst pitch relationship ever. They hate each other with horrible fury, slightly ironically making an oath to hit the stump if they EVER see each other in real life. This is mostly thanks to his pedantic correctiveness and by sharing Keelez's over-obsession with the little things.
Either way, before the oath, they've helped each other become better at their goals, and they would have been somewhat great moirails if, you know, they wouldn't immediately tear at the guts of one another as soon as a small glance was made.
