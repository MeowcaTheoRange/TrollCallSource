Thaobi is a troll hatched in a generation victim to GENERATIONAL SPITBOMBING -- an act performed by non-troll species, to cripple an entire generaton of trolls and get them all culled.
Basically, if you aren't a troll, depositing your genetic material in The Bucket will be considered a warcrime.
As such, the Alternain government wants him dead, in order to prevent him from breeding and continuing this impure act. It isn't his fault, he was just born this way. It is what it is.
Speaking of,  "It is what it is." is kind of his tagline. He says it anytime a minor/major inconvenience happens to him, because that's what he truly believes. Over and over, it doesn't matter if he repeats it.
Genuinely, he is scared for his life. He can't help his own situation, and he can't make any friends without them being considered felons as well. He has seen the mass culling of his generation and has ran for basically all his life.

Oh, well. <i>It is what it is.</i>
