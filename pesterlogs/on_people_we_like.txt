thaobi: Keels
thaobi: Hey Keelez
keelez: Hi? What do you need?
thaobi: Do you like... like anybody?
thaobi: I haven't really had time to figure myself out so
thaobi: I just wanted to ask what liking someone is like.
thaobi: You know?
keelez: Umm, well...
keelez: It's complicated. You just have to look at people until you find someone you're attracted to.
keelez: Figure out the quadrant, then... there you go. You're liking somebody.
thaobi: Quadrant?
keelez: ...Oh, right.
keelez: Let's just focus on matespritship for now.
thaobi: You're not making sense...
keelez: You've been outside, right? And you've seen people kiss, right?
thaobi: Yeah?
keelez: That usually stems from matespritship.
thaobi: OK.
keelez: So, that being said, my crushes throughout my life have been on girls.
keelez: That would mean my ideal matesprit would be female.
thaobi: I honestly don't know who I'm attracted to.
thaobi: Being attracted to your own gender is normal right
thaobi: Like, that's the norm?
keelez: No, not the whole norm. Some people are attracted to the opposite gender.
thaobi: What
thaobi: That's weird.
