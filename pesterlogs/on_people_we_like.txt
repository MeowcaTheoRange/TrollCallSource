thaobi: Keels
thaobi: Hey Keelez
keelez: Who?
thaobi: Oh sorry I forgot lol
keelez: ...
thaobi: OP Do you like... like anybody?
thaobi: I haven't really had time to figure myself out so
thaobi: I just wanted to ask what liking someone is like.
thaobi: You know?
keelez: ...Well,
keelez: It's complicated. You just have to look at people until you find someone you're attracted to.
keelez: Figure out the quadrant, then... there you go. You're liking somebody.
thaobi: Quadrant?
keelez: ...right.
keelez: Let's just focus on matespritship for now.
thaobi: You're not making sense...
keelez: You've been outside, right? And you've seen people kiss, right?
thaobi: Yeah?
keelez: That usually stems from matespritship.
thaobi: OK.
keelez: So. For example, let's say my crushes throughout my life have been on girls.
keelez: That would mean my ideal matesprit would be female.
thaobi: I honestly don't know who I'm attracted to.
thaobi: Being attracted to your own gender is normal right
thaobi: Like, that's the norm?
keelez: No, not the whole norm. Some people are attracted to the opposite gender.
thaobi: What
thaobi: That's weird.
keelez: It's not weird, it's normal.
keelez: Both are normal.
thaobi: Ok
thaobi: Anyway who do you like?
keelez: What? I haven't really met anyone I like.
keelez: I mean, OK, I guess there's this one girl.
keelez: She's kinda cute, I guess. But. Matespritship is a huge responsibility, and don't think I can pick *anyone* for it.
keelez: I haven't... gotten to know her that well.
thaobi: Aww
thaobi: You've got a crush lol
keelez: 
keelez: You could put it that way. I have a flushed crush.
thaobi: So... Who's the special someone?
keelez: What? I'm not telling you.
keelez: You're always bad at keeping secrets.
thaobi: Lol, can't help myself sorry
thaobi: So who is it?
keelez: fucking
keelez: You know what?
keelez: It's Madhie.
thaobi: Who
keelez: The jade girl. Much longer hair than me. Pointier ears.
thaobi: Um
thaobi: Right. Her?
keelez: Yes. Her.
thaobi: Ok
thaobi: Well cool
thaobi: See you later lol
