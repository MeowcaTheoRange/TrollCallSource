keelez: And what about it? I use what I want. You literally can't do anything about it other than come here and risk having to kill yourself.

joltif: like, come on, what did you think i was using
joltif: gnome?? like a stupid, fucking loser??
keelez: Oh, I dunno, maybe one of the many OTHER environments out there
keelez: Since you love using your keyboard so much why don't you fill a pail with it. I'd love to see what would happen.

joltif: of dragging your fucking weasel of a cursor everywhere, to do basic shit
joltif: like opening a fucking terminal
keelez: Grrr I'm so angry. God I'm so mad at this RUTHLESS attempt at my integrity
keelez: Go kick some rocks Joltif. Take you and your keyboard warrior member toy somewhere out of my face so I can be at peace.
joltif: it sounds like you're mad, lol
